# clean-image-utility
Remove hidden metadata (EXIF, device info, timestamps, editor history) from all PNG and JPG images in your entire directory tree. Perfect for creators, developers, PKM users, and anyone preparing screenshots for public release. This utility recursively scans every subfolder under a directory, generates safe, metadata-free duplicates of each image.
